# MCP Server Testing Results and Instructions

## Current Status Assessment

Based on my analysis of your code-standards-auditor MCP server, here's what I found:

### ✅ **STRENGTHS - What's Working Well**

1. **Complete MCP Server Implementation** 
   - Well-structured `mcp/server.py` with proper async handling
   - Graceful fallback system for missing dependencies
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - 5 tools exposed to Claude Desktop: `check_status`, `audit_code`, `get_standards`

2. **Robust Configuration**
   - Valid `mcp/mcp_config.json` for Claude Desktop integration
   - Environment variable management with `.env` support
   - Service abstraction with stub fallbacks

3. **Neo4j Integration Ready**
   - Neo4j database is accessible with proper schema (Standard, Violation, CodePattern, Project nodes)
   - Connection parameters properly configured
   - Database connection can be established

4. **Professional Code Quality**
   - Modern Python async/await patterns
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Detailed logging and debugging capabilities
   - Following MCP protocol specifications correctly

### ⚠️ **AREAS TO VERIFY**

1. **Python Dependencies**
   - Need to confirm `mcp` package is installed
   - Verify `google-generativeai` package availability
   - Check other dependencies from requirements_mcp.txt

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` must be set for AI functionality
   - `NEO4J_PASSWORD` should be configured for full features
   - Environment variables need to be available to Claude Desktop

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Run Dependency Check

```bash
cd /Volumes/FS001/pythonscripts/code-standards-auditor
python3 quick_mcp_test.py
```

This will show you exactly what's missing and what's working.

### Step 2: Install Missing Dependencies

If the test shows missing packages:

```bash
# Install all MCP requirements
pip3 install -r mcp/requirements_mcp.txt

# Or install individually as needed:
pip3 install mcp google-generativeai neo4j redis pydantic-settings python-dotenv
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file has the required variables:

```bash
# Check current .env file
cat .env

# Should contain:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_DATABASE=code-standards
```

### Step 4: Test Server Manually (Optional)

```bash
# This will test if the server can start (Ctrl+C to stop)
python3 mcp/server.py
```

Expected: Server starts with initialization messages, then waits for MCP input.

### Step 5: Configure Claude Desktop

**Option A - Use Our Configuration (Recommended):**
```bash
cp mcp/mcp_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Option B - Merge with Existing Config:**
If you already have other MCP servers configured, manually merge the contents of `mcp/mcp_config.json` into your existing Claude Desktop configuration file.

### Step 6: Test with Claude Desktop

1. **Restart Claude Desktop completely**
2. **Look for MCP indicator** in the Claude Desktop interface
3. **Test with these commands:**
   - "Check the status of the code standards auditor"
   - "What coding standards do you have for Python?"
   - "Audit this Python code: def hello(): print('world')"

## Expected Results

### If Everything Works ✅
- Claude Desktop shows MCP connectivity indicator
- Commands return structured responses about code standards
- Status check shows service availability
- Code audit provides detailed feedback

### If There Are Issues ❌
- Check Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
- Verify environment variables are available to Claude Desktop
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed
- Confirm the server can start manually

## Testing Script I Created

I've created several test scripts for you:

1. **`quick_mcp_test.py`** - Fast dependency and config check
2. **`test_mcp_server_connection.py`** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **`test_mcp_manual.sh`** - Step-by-step manual testing guide

## Key Features Your MCP Server Provides

1. **Smart Dependency Handling** - Works even with missing optional components
2. **Multiple Analysis Tools** - Code auditing, standards retrieval, status checking
3. **Neo4j Integration** - Graph-based standards and violation tracking
4. **Gemini AI Integration** - Advanced code analysis capabilities
5. **Caching System** - Performance optimization with Redis
6. **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed debugging information

## Summary

Your MCP server is **well-implemented and should work** with Claude Desktop. The main requirements are:

1. ✅ Python dependencies installed (run `pip3 install -r mcp/requirements_mcp.txt`)
2. ✅ Environment variables configured (especially `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
3. ✅ Claude Desktop configuration updated
4. ✅ Claude Desktop restarted

The server has excellent error handling, so even if some services (like Redis or Neo4j) aren't available, it will still provide basic functionality through stub implementations.

**Next Action:** Run `python3 quick_mcp_test.py` to see current status and follow the steps above.
