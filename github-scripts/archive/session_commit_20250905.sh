## Session Summary - September 05, 2025

### Issue Fixed: MCP Server Launch Error ✅

**Problem**: MCP server failing to start with "file not found" error
- Error: `/mcp_server/server.py` not found
- Root cause: Server implementation was at `/mcp_server/mcp/server.py`

**Solution Applied**:
1. Created launcher script at expected location (`mcp_server/server.py`)
2. Launcher properly imports and runs the actual server
3. Verified configuration points to correct paths
4. Created comprehensive fix and verification scripts

### Files Created/Modified:
- `mcp_server/server.py` - Launcher script (new)
- `fix_mcp_launch.sh` - Quick fix script
- `verify_mcp_setup.py` - Comprehensive setup verification
- `test_mcp_launch.py` - Test script for server launch
- `update_claude_config.sh` - Config update helper
- `MCP_CONFIG_STATUS.md` - Configuration status report
- `DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` - Updated with current session info
- `README.md` - Added v2.0.5 release notes

### Configuration Status:
✅ Claude Desktop configuration is CORRECT
- Command: `python3`
- Path: `/Volumes/FS001/pythonscripts/code-standards-auditor/mcp_server/server.py`
- Environment variables properly passed through

### Next Steps for User:
1. Run: `./fix_mcp_launch.sh` to install dependencies
2. Update Claude Desktop config if needed
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. MCP server should now start successfully

### Cleanup Performed:
- Created script to archive old MCP diagnostic scripts
- Ready to clean up ~40 old diagnostic/fix scripts
