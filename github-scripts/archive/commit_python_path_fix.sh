git commit -m "fix: Solve Python path mismatch for MCP installation

## Problem Solved
pip3 and python3 were using different Python installations,
causing 'MCP not found' errors even after successful pip install.

## Solution
Created intelligent installers that use 'python3 -m pip' to ensure
packages install to the correct Python installation.

## Files Added
- diagnose_python_paths.py: Comprehensive path diagnostic
- smart_mcp_install.sh: Intelligent installer with path detection
- quick_mcp_fix.sh: 10-second fix script
- verify_mcp.py: Installation verification tool
- PYTHON_PATH_SOLUTION.md: Clear problem explanation

## Files Updated
- README.md: Added Python path troubleshooting section
- DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md: Documented the issue and solution

## How It Works
Instead of: pip3 install mcp (may use wrong Python)
Now using: python3 -m pip install mcp (uses correct Python)

This ensures packages install where Python can find them.

## Testing
Run: ./quick_mcp_fix.sh
Verify: python3 verify_mcp.py

Fixes: MCP package not found after installation
Type: fix
Scope: installation
Breaking: no"
