fix: Comprehensive MCP server fixes with pip-only approach

🔧 **COMPREHENSIVE MCP SERVER FIXES (PIP-ONLY)**

**Critical Issues Resolved:**
✅ Neo4j Version Compatibility
- Updated requirements to Neo4j >=5.28.2 (matches user's installation)
- Fixed authentication with comprehensive credential testing
- Removed all homebrew dependencies - pure pip approach
- Added multiple Neo4j setup options (Docker, Desktop, AuraDB, manual)

✅ MCP Protocol Communication Fixes
- Fixed "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON" error
- Redirected ALL logging to stderr (critical for MCP stdio protocol)
- Added safe_json_dumps() with proper error handling
- Enhanced JSON serialization with ensure_ascii=False

✅ Repository Organization
- Moved all GitHub scripts to github-scripts/ directory
- Updated .gitignore to exclude automation scripts  
- Clean separation of production and development code
- Organized tooling for better maintainability

**Enhanced Development Tools:**
🚀 comprehensive_diagnostic_fix.py - Pip-only diagnostic suite
- Neo4j server connectivity testing (no homebrew required)
- Automatic dependency installation via pip
- Multiple Neo4j setup guidance (Docker, Desktop, cloud)
- Complete MCP server functionality validation

🚀 Neo4j Setup Options (No Homebrew Required)
- Docker-based setup (recommended)
- Neo4j Desktop installation
- Neo4j AuraDB cloud setup  
- Manual server installation
- Comprehensive setup guide generation

**Environment & Configuration:**
- Intelligent .env file management with backups
- System environment variable integration
- Automatic credential detection and validation
- Clear status reporting for all services

**Key Technical Improvements:**
- 🔧 MCP stdio protocol compliance (stderr logging only)
- 🔧 Neo4j 5.28.2+ compatibility and version matching
- 🔧 Robust JSON handling with comprehensive error recovery
- 🔧 Service initialization with graceful degradation
- 🔧 Pip-only dependency management (no homebrew required)

**Multiple Neo4j Setup Paths:**
- 🐳 Docker: docker run neo4j:5.28 (recommended)
- 🖥️  Neo4j Desktop application 
- ☁️  Neo4j AuraDB cloud service
- 🔧 Manual server installation
- 📖 Comprehensive setup guide included

**Development Experience:**
- ✅ Comprehensive diagnostic tool with automatic fixes
- ✅ Clear setup instructions for all Neo4j options
- ✅ Repository organization and script management
- ✅ Enhanced error messages and troubleshooting
- ✅ Pip-based workflow (no system package managers)

**Compatibility & Testing:**
- ✅ Neo4j 5.28.2+ (user's installed version)
- ✅ MCP 1.0+ protocol compliance
- ✅ Python 3.8+ with asyncio support
- ✅ macOS M1 development environment
- ✅ All components tested and validated

This comprehensive fix eliminates all MCP server issues using a
pip-only approach, provides multiple Neo4j setup options, and
establishes a robust, dependency-flexible development environment.

**No homebrew required** - Compatible with any development setup.
